# Python_AirBnB Data Analysis

## Overview
- This is a Python-based data analysis project focused on Airbnb listings. It demonstrates practical data analysis skills including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving business insights from real-world data.

## Project Structure
1. Import libraries
2. Load dataset
3. Initial exploration
4. Data cleaning
5. Data analysis

## Data Source
Airbnb_listing.csv 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data and uncover useful insights such as:

- Price trends
- Room type distribution
- Location-based availability
- Host behavior and frequency
- Identification and removal of outliers

## Tools and Library
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Result
1. Cleaned and Structured Dataset
  The original raw Airbnb dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing outliers and standardizing formats. As a result, more   reliable dataset ready for analysis.

2. Outlier Detection
  Outliers in columns like price, minimum_nights, and number_of_reviews were identified and removed to avoid skewed insights.
  
3. Descriptive Analysis
  Basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) were determined

4. Visual Insights
  The notebook includes various plots (histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, etc.) to visualize such as:
  - Listing counts by neighborhood
  - Group by room type
  - Price vs. number of reviews
  - Availability patterns

## Summary
- This project transforms raw Airbnb data into actionable insights by applying core data science techniques: cleaning, EDA, and   visualization. It demonstrates the value of using Python and data analytics to understand market behavior and inform decisions.
